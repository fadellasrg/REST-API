<h1 align="center">How to Create a Serverless RESTful API with NodeJs, MySQL and AWS Lambda</h1>

## Endpoints
- [My API URL](https://38qvnu90k1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/api/products)
<p>Here, I had successfully created simple RESTful API with the following two endpoints:</p>

| No  | HTTP Method | URI                               | Operation                                 |
| --- | ----------- | ----------------------------------| ----------------------------------------- |
| 1   | GET         | /api/products/                    | Get all products data                     |
| 2   | POST        | /api/products/                    | Insert new product data                   |
